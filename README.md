Abstract
========

Inaccuracies in the stratigraphic models of coal deposits can result in significant financial losses and operational disruptions in the coal industry. The two common modelling approaches are using independent structural surfaces for roof and floor or stacking thickness grids from a reference surface. These approaches are adequate for the majority of coal deposits but display difficulties in representing the complex geological structures encountered in steeply dipping and folded coal deposits. These methods encounter challenges with conflicting control strings, inconsistent thickness representation, and the inability to accurately account for true stratigraphic thickness in the presence of dipping strata and non-vertical boreholes. This paper presents a novel stratigraphic modelling methodology by combining in-situ data, trigonometric calculations for true thickness determination, and Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) for smooth interpolation of thickness grids. Application of this approach to complex coal deposits has demonstrated improved reconciliation between scheduled tonnages and geological models. The findings suggest this methodology has the potential to enhance the accuracy and precision of coal volume estimation, contributing to more effective production forecasting and resource management in the coal industry.

Introduction
------------

A primary challenge in coal operations is the mismatch between modelled and actual production volumes. This discrepancy arises from multiple factors, and apart from mining practices, is determined by the structural complexity and limitations of modelling methods.

Traditional modelling approaches, including the use of independent structural surfaces for roof and floor and the stacking of thickness grids on a reference surface, often fall short in accurately representing the complex geological structures in steeply dipping and folded coal deposits (Figure 1). These methods grapple with challenges such as conflicting control strings, inconsistent thickness representation, and the inability to precisely account for true stratigraphic thickness when strata are dipping, and boreholes are non-vertical.

These challenges can lead to significant over- or under-estimation of coal volumes, resulting in financial losses, missed production targets, and inefficient mine planning. Despite the industries awareness of these challenges, traditional modelling algorithms have seen minimal innovation for decades.

While the modelling approaches to less structurally complex coal seams have historically been successful in large-scale operations (>8 Mtpa), their accuracy may not be sufficient for smaller operations (1-3 Mtpa) in complex geological settings. In complex deposits, even minor variations can significantly impact the ability to meet production goals. Given the advancements in computing technology, a reassessment of the industry-standard modelling algorithms, some of which have been in use for over 30 years, is warranted to determine their continued suitability.
